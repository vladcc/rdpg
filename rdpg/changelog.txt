rdpg.awk v1.0 -> v1.11
change - forms '{goal,fail} return {true,false,call}' are now reduced only to
'return {true,false,call}', i.e. the goal/fail is removed, so the return
statements can transparently go through the optimization process

rdpg-opt.awk v1.0 -> v1.1
bug fix - drop_redundant_else() screwed up when a function had no else clause in
Olvl=2, which was throwing Olvl=3 in an infinite recursion
change - the order of optimization passes; unreachable code is removed first
change - -TOK- syntax is removed; can be achieved with an optional rule

rdpg-to-awk.awk v1.0 -> v1.01; rdpg-to-c.awk v1.0 -> v1.01
change - IR_GOAL() and IR_FAIL() code emit cleanup because of the change in
rdpg.awk

run-tests.sh
test added - opt_olvl_3_inf_loop_fix
test added - version_checks
