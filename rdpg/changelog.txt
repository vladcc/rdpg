rdpg.awk v1.0 -> v1.1
bug fix - pft_add(); the prefix tree would overwrite already existing values
pft_add_bug_fix test added

rdpg.awk v1.0 -> v1.11
change - forms '{goal,fail} return {true,false,call}' are now reduced only to
'return {true,false,call}', i.e. the goal/fail is removed, so the return
statements can transparently go through the optimization process

rdpg-opt.awk v1.0 -> v1.1
bug fix - drop_redundant_else() screwed up when a function had no else clause in
Olvl=2, which was throwing Olvl=3 in an infinite recursion
change - the order of optimization passes; unreachable code is removed first

rdpg-to-awk.awk v1.0 -> v1.01; rdpg-to-c.awk v1.0 -> v1.01
IR_GOAL() and IR_FAIL() code emit cleanup because of the change in rdpg.awk
